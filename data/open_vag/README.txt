This dataset contains 89 vibroarthrographic signals (VAG or knee-joint sound signals) recorded from 51 normal subjects (novag**) with no knee-joint pathology and 38 subjects with various types of knee-joint pathology (abvag**), including chondromalacia of different grades at the patella, meniscal tear, tibial chondromalacia, and anterior cruciate ligament injuries, as confirmed by arthroscopic examination. Individual cases in the dataset are not labeled with the details of the associated pathology and the dataset is not adequate to permit classification of the signals into various types or stages of pathology. No additional information is available (such as knee-joint angle and segmentation of the signals into parts). The dataset may be considered to be outdated.
