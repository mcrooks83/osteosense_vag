fft over segements of the signal may help determine things (power, intensity etc) - 100 - 500 hz
cyclic loading produces a large varaibility in the normal patellofemoral joint 


consider FF (form Factor) a measure of complexity in the signal

    standard deviation of the second derivative / standard deviation of the first derivative 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    standard deviation of the first derivative / standard deviation 

Try to use a combination of features to improve classification

RBF network has been used for classifiation
spread = 4
with 15 hidden nodes, including the LOO procedure.
