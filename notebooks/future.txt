split the vag signals in half for extension and flexion

consider FF (form Factor) a measure of complexity in the signal

    standard deviation of the second derivative / standard deviation of the first derivative 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    standard deviation of the first derivative / standard deviation 


compute the mean-squared (MS) values of a given VAG signal in ﬁxed-duration segments of 5 ms each,
and then compute the variance of the values of the parameter over the entire duration of the signal

Note that the VMS values represent the variability (variance) of power in the signal.

Do this for extension and flexion phases also

RBF network has been used for classifiation
spread = 4
with 15 hidden nodes, including the LOO procedure.

Features:
For a given VAG signal compute:
VMS -> variance of the mean squared at 5ms intervals 
VMS1 -> same as VMS but for extension phase
VMS2 -> same but of flexion phase
FD -> for complete signal 
FD1 -> for extension phase
FD2 -> for flexion phase
