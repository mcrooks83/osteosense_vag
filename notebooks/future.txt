consider FF (form Factor) a measure of complexity in the signal

    standard deviation of the second derivative / standard deviation of the first derivative 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    standard deviation of the first derivative / standard deviation 


RBF network has been used for classifiation
spread = 4
with 15 hidden nodes, including the LOO procedure.

Features:
For a given VAG signal compute:
VMS -> variance of the mean squared at 5ms intervals 
VMS1 -> same as VMS but for extension phase
VMS2 -> same but of flexion phase
FD -> for complete signal 
FD1 -> for extension phase
FD2 -> for flexion phase
