Estimated parameters: 
variation of mean square (VMS), difference between
mean of four maximum and mean of four minimum values (R4), 
power spectral density for frequency of 50–250 Hz (P1) and 250–450 Hz (P2)

50 Hz threshold for high-pass filtration

1 cm above the apex of the patella

Both flexion/extension motion and
measuring condition constant velocities were kept at
82 beats per minute with a metronome.


The variability ofthe VAG signal was assessed by computing the mean-
squared values of the obtained signal in fixed-duration
segments of 5 ms each, and then by computing the vari-
ance over the entire duration of the signal (VMS)

The short-time spectra were obtained by computing the
discrete Fourier transform of segments of 150 samples
each, the Hanning window and a 100-sample overlap of
each segment. The spectral activity was analyzed by
summing the spectral power of the VAG signal in two
bands: 50–250 Hz (P1) and 250–450 Hz (P2)
