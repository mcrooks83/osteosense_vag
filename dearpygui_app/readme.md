### Dear Py GUI

windows are used as components.  

### Windows in the app

- Settings - UI component that has access to the settings class
- raw data plot - plot the raw streamed data
- vag plot - plot the filtered  data 
- spectrogram - plot the spectrogram 
- controls - sonify, record etc

### 
plots have alot of features such as draging areas etc, annotations etc
windows can be docked (which is cool)
menu should be able to close and re open windows (states could be saved between sessions, animation is possible)
